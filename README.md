# Heya!  I'm AC1DR41N

**Pronouns:** he/she

I’m a 16 year old coder with a love for **reverse engineering, assembly, and C++**. 
I looooove coding and working on new projects and I’m always open to learn new ways to level up my skills.  

Outside of coding, you’ll often find me exploring things like:  
-  Gaming
-  Anime & Manga 
-  Music 
-  Chilling with my cat (He's a silly goober >:3c) 

I like to keep my projects **friendly, approachable, and open** — whether it’s small experiments or full-fledged projects.
