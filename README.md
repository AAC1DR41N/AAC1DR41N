# Heya! 👋 I'm AC1DR41N

**Pronouns:** he/she

I’m a 16 year old coder with a love for **reverse engineering, assembly, and C++**. 
I looooove coding and working on new projects and I’m always opent to learn new ways to level up my skills.  

Outside of coding, you’ll often find me exploring:  
- 🎮 Gaming
- 📺 Anime & Manga 
- 🎵 Music 
- 🐱 Chilling with my cat (He's a silly goober >:3c) 

I like to keep my projects **friendly, approachable, and open** — whether it’s small experiments or full-fledged projects.
